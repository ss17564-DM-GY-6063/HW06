# Theme
I've chosen snowy days as the theme for my project. During my research for snow-related poetry, I came across a beautiful poem, "White Noise" by Barbara Vance.

# The Animation and Text
I decided to make the text gently fall down the screen, simulating snowflakes.

# Challenges
While working on animating the text, I tried to break down the sentence into individual words after referencing the tutorial, it failed first, so I also added variables and aligned them with the setup variables, and finally, it worked. 

I wanted to change the transparency of each word independently. To achieve this, I had to incorporate the "random" function within a for loop, otherwise would cause all the text on the screen to flicker simultaneously.

# References
I referred to the tutorial from the syllabus, specifically the concepts of random, strings, and arrays. Additionally, I learned how to import images as background elements in p5.
